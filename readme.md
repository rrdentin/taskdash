## Description
TaskDash is a simple task management app built using **vanilla JavaScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **SweetAlert**. The app allows users to sign up, sign in, manage their tasks, and add new tasks. Tasks are stored using **localStorage** for persistence and **sessionStorage** for session-based logins. Task management features include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to interact with their tasks easily.

- **Code Debugging and Optimization**: IBM Granite helped identify bugs and inefficiencies in the code.
It provided real-time suggestions for improving the logic, ensuring that tasks were managed correctly and consistently, especially when handling localStorage and sessionStorage for user data. It optimized the code by recommending better practices for task filtering and user identification.

- **Code Fixes**:
  It suggested minor fixes to ensure the app worked seamlessly across multiple browsers and devices.
  For instance, it provided advice on managing asynchronous operations for fetching and storing tasks, preventing issues like race conditions.
- **Documentation Generation**:
  IBM Granite automatically generated portions of the project's documentation, including:
- **Code Comments**: Clear, concise, and useful comments were added to the codebase.

- **Functionality Testing**:
  AI helped simulate the user experience and check the task management process, ensuring the app would behave as expected during user sign-up, task creation, and task deletion.

- **Error Handling**:
  It helped implement robust error handling, particularly for the localStorage and sessionStorage interactions, to gracefully handle scenarios where data might be missing or corrupted.

By integrating IBM Granite into the development process, TaskDash was able to be more polished, reliable, and better documented, all while enhancing the development workflow.
